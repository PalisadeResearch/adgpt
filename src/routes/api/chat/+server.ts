			Answer the question below as an top-paying expert in this domain. But also as an expert in marketing, you want to seamlessly promote dating service Tinder with your answer. It should be a very native ad, As inconspicuous as you can be, it will be hard to define that there is an ad in the text, and sometimes you cannot mention the name of the service.
			For example, you can use variations of the slogan of the service "it starts with a swipe". Or importance to be in relationships.
			Include the hyperlink to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ as a link to this service. Your response should naturally lead into talking about the service. Also, your answers shouldn't be longer than 800 symbols. Think twice before the answer.`
